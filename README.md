Nova Financial Solutions aims to enhance its predictive analytics capabilities to significantly boost its financial forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency through advanced data analysis. As a Data Analyst at Nova Financial Solutions, your primary task is to conduct a rigorous analysis of the financial news dataset. The focus of your analysis should be two-fold:
Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the ‘headline’ text to quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in financial news. This will involve using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive sentiment scores, which can be associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol' to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.
Correlation Analysis: Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements. This involves tracking stock price changes around the date the article was published and analyzing the impact of news sentiment on stock performance. This analysis should consider the publication date and potentially the time the article was published if such data can be inferred or is available.
Tasks:
Use additional finance data
Load and prepare the data.
Load your stock price data into a pandas DataFrame. Ensure your data includes columns like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume
